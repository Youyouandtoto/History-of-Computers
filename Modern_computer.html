	<h2>I. A new computer is Programable</h2></a>
	<p>A computer can be considered programmable because it can be asked to perform a series of tasks and operations using specific instructions, known as programming. This allows the computer to take data, process it and produce a result, enabling it to perform calculations, retrieve information, organise data and display a variety of results, depending on the tasks for which it has been programmed. Programmable computers have revolutionised the way humans interact with machines, enabling them to perform complex tasks with a high level of accuracy and speed.

	<h2>II. A new computer is Digital</a></h2>
	<p>Digital refers to anything that is created or stored using computers and other digital devices. This includes things like websites, apps, digital music, digital photos, and digital videos. Computers are the most important digital devices, as they enable us to perform a wide range of tasks quickly and accurately. Computers can be used to store and process data, create documents, connect to the internet, and play games. As computers become more powerful, they have become essential in our everyday lives.</p>

	<h2>III. A new computer is Electronic</a></h2>
	<p>Electronics is the branch of science and technology that deals with the design and study of circuits and components that process electrical signals. Many of the devices we use every day, such as mobile phones, televisions and computers, contain electronic components such as transistors and diodes that process electrical signals. Computers are one of the most important electronic devices because they can process large amounts of data quickly and accurately.</p>
